            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Kings moſt Excellent Maieſty, taking notice that</hi> there are ſundry Manors, Lands, Tenements, and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditaments in the actuall poſſeſſion of diuers of His louing Subiects, either by deſcent from their anceſtors, or by their owne purchaſes, which neuertheleſſe doe in truth and right belong vnto His Maieſty, as His owne proper inheritance, The pretended owners thereof, either hauing no Grant at all from the Crowne, whereby to deriue good tytles to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or elſe ſuch grants as haue beene ſurreptitiouſly gotten vpon falſe ſuggeſtions, or by other deceitfull courſes, or are otherwiſe defectiue and inſufficient in Law; So as His Maieſty might by His royall prerogatiue and right, take aduantage thereof, to ſeize the ſame Mannors and Lands into His hands, and ſo leaue the ſaid pretended owners without reliefe: Which might vpon iuſt reaſon be done, conſidering that both the late Queene Elizabeth in Her time, and His Maieſty ſithence, haue by ſeuerall Commiſſions of Grace awarded for confirmation of all ſuch defectiue tytles, and by former publique proclamations, as by ſo many ſolemne warnings, ſummoned and inuited all perſons, whom the ſame might concerne, vpon eaſie and honorable compoſitions to preuent their owne dangers in this behalfe; which hitherto they haue contemned, or neglected to doe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:188354:2"/>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, His Maieſty, out of His Princely clemency and vnwillingneſſe to take any ſtrict courſes againſt His louing Subiects, hath beene graciouſly pleaſed, once more to renew His ſaid Commiſſion to ſundry of His Priuy Councell, and others of His Iudges &amp; Councell learned, authorizing them to treat &amp; compound with any perſon or perſons on His Maieſties behalfe, for confirming &amp; making good of their defectiue Titles or Eſtates, according to the courſe heeretofore vſed in like Commiſſions: But with this expectation, that as it pleaſeth His Maieſty, in his gracious well-wiſhing to the peace and quiet of His louing Subiects, thus to incline to them, and forbeare to take notice of their former negligences, So now they will be aduiſed vpon this renewed offer of his Grace to neglect the ſame no longer; leſt after ſo many warnings, the ſame be iuſtly taken from them.</p>
            <p>And therefore His Maieſty doth ſtraitly charge and command all perſons whom it may concerne, by this publike declaration of His Will and Pleaſure, to take ſuch notice thereof, that voluntarily, or vpon letters to them directed from His Maieſties Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, with a draught of the particular caſe, whereupon their Title ſhall be queſtioned, they faile not at their perills to attend the ſaid Commiſſioners, for ſuch moderate and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable compoſitions, as ſhall be found fit and equall for confirmation of their eſtates, and cleering all doubts of the ſame: Letting them all to wit, that in caſe they ſhall neglect this offer of his Princely goodneſſe and fauour towards them, in not appearing, or not compounding for the ſetling of their lands and poſſeſſions in peace; As His Maieſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to make any ſecond or new treaties, with thoſe that ſhall ſhew themſelues wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and refractary in this behalfe, So they ſhall haue no iuſt cauſe to complaine of any but themſelues, if contrary to His Maieſties princely inclination, he be inforced to more ſeuere courſes, for recouering and maintaining the Reuenues of His Crowne, againſt all intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and vnlawfull vſurpations and poſſeſſions whatſoeuer.</p>
